Power BI dashboard analyzing traffic congestion across 254 European cities - RomanianDATA Tribe Challenge

🎯 Project Overview
This project transforms raw traffic data from the TomTom Traffic Index into actionable insights about urban mobility across Europe. The dashboard reveals critical patterns in:

Travel Time Efficiency: Average time per 10km across cities
Congestion Levels: Percentage-based congestion metrics
Year-over-Year Trends: Changes from 2023 to 2025
Time Lost: Annual hours wasted in rush hour traffic
Geographic Patterns: Regional mobility challenges

Key Insights Discovered
🔴 Dublin leads in city center congestion at 47%, with commuters losing 155 hours annually
🏆 Bucharest ranks #1 globally for metropolitan area congestion
📈 72% of cities show worsening traffic compared to 2023
⚡ Only 8% of cities improved - Wroclaw being a notable success story
💡 40% congestion threshold: Cities above this level see exponential time losses
